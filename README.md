# Transformer (Text Generation) Part 2

This section covers fine-tuning the GPT2 pre-trained model using pytorch-transformers and generating new text based on a given sentence.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install `pytorch-transformers`. You can do this via pip: 
pip install pytorch-transformers


## Fine-tuning the Pre-trained Model

Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can fine-tune the pre-trained GPT2 model on your custom dataset. Ensure that your dataset is prepared and formatted appropriately for training. You can generate your own dataset or use an existing one.

To fine-tune the model, you can follow the steps outlined in the tutorial provided [here](https://gist.github.com/mf1024/3df214d2f17f3dcc56450ddf0d5a4cd7).

## Generating Text

After fine-tuning the model, you can generate new paragraphs of text based on a given sentence. The tutorial mentioned above provides a detailed guide on how to generate text using the fine-tuned model.

## Additional Resources

For further information and detailed instructions, refer to the tutorial linked above. Additionally, you can explore the official documentation of `pytorch-transformers` for more advanced usage and features.
